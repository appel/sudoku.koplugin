# KOReader Sudoku Plugin

This plugin brings a straightforward Sudoku experience to KOReader so you can solve puzzles while reading.

## Features
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Controls optimized for touch
- Automatic progress saving

I forked this plugin from [omer-faruq/sudoku.koplugin](https://github.com/omer-faruq/sudoku.koplugin) to add a few features I wanted. Figured I'd put it up here in case others might like it, too. I am not well versed in Lua, so I used Claude AI to add these features. [Click here](https://github.com/omer-faruq/sudoku.koplugin/compare/main...appel:sudoku.koplugin:main) to see the changes compared to the original.

- Highlight selected number across the board
- Grey out numbers that are complete
- Slightly smaller font size for the board

There's another fork by jan-herz which adds [even more features](https://github.com/omer-faruq/sudoku.koplugin/discussions/4#discussioncomment-15884437) in addition to mine. You can find that fork [here](https://github.com/jan-herz/sudoku.koplugin).
